APIs Automation Karate Framework

Open the AutomationApisRunner.java and run.

The project works by sending a request to an end point which requires a body to be sent or only an id depends on the type of service
to be able to consume the service correctly,
Additional must specify the type of method that we are going to consume and requires an expected result that in our case would be the status 200 which means that
the API responded correctly and a match is made to verify that the API response is what we expected.

As a point of improvement, the architecture of the APis can be modified to respond faster.
